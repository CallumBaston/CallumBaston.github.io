# My Web Portfolio
This is the GitHub repository for my website [Baston.uk][1]. I have been building this website for use as a web portfolio. This repository contains all the things necessary for a good open source project on GitHub such as a good [license][2], a [code of conduct][3], a well thought out [CONTRIBUTING.md][4] and issue templates. This is essentially a testing ground for me to post my projects and have fun with leaning what I'm doing.

I chose this license because I want someone to be able to adapt this and use it as a template for their portfolio however I don't want it to be used by a business for their website. The license also requires that you give appropriate credit and provide a [link to the license][5].
