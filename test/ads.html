	<h6>note to self: all of this stuff.</h6>
	<h7>This code was getting smaller due to the syle.css file. The css document is governing how the page looks. It can change things such as fonts, size, color and it can also add things such as the box sourounding the hyperlink to google. CSS can also change things due to users action like how the google box changes color when a user holds there mouse cursor over the google box, however is is still limited in its resources and power witch is why things like java script are added to improve the website design and feel. The programs I use to edit code are ether Notepad++ or adobe Dreamweaver (Expencive af). Notepad++ is very usefull as it starts almost instantly, its light weaght meaning in can be put on a pendrive also it uses very little resources. Adobie Dreamwever is a very powerfull tool that has loads of fetures but is expencive af.</h7>
	<p>This is a small website that could inform users on how to use images and links useing them</p>

		<h2>Don't bother going beond this point as it's just notes and me typing stuff because I can</h2>
		<h2>
			So I want to be realy good at touch typeing, so far I'm typeing at around 25 words per minute and have about a 91% accuracy at the moment. I am practicing evey day and am gradually increasing in speed.
		</h2>
		<h2>
			So it's been about 3 weeks and I am now topping out at 35 words per minute however my accuracy has not changed. I can defonitly feel that I am typeing faster and am able to type in class without needing to look at the keybord at a reasonable speed. I'm going to start to add stuff to this testing page withing the testing brantch of the GitHub repostatory. This test folder adds about 3.1MB of bloat to the 24MB website (as of writeing this). I think that the next time I type here the site will have multiplyed in size by 10x due to the meny more pages and probabully mainly the blog. I'm writeing this at 9pm so i've been at my computer for 24 hours straght and am just going to start to ramble now about stuff. I hope this thing dose'nt turn into a blog type thing. That would be a mess because I think that personal blogs that are just rambling are usless and pointless (yes I get the irony). I think that because I just dont like to read personal blogs about an indivigual person. It feels like I'm invadeing somones privacy. I'm going to try and type as fast as I can without fixing errors. You have the human right to privacuy and should bnot have to send a meme to prive that you arre a meme lord.

		<h2>
			It's now the next night after the last entry and I'm now going to call this my personal blog and I'm taking a small break from making my website because I'm just tired atm due to collage being mad atm. My ilitracy is starting to really show here because I simply cannot be bothered checking what I've just typed. But I always going to wite this when I'm tired. I want to buy an IPv6 block. More spacifically a block with a CIDR of /108 so I can have 1,048,576 IPv6 addresses, bout a milion. There are no IPv4 adresses any more so buying my own adress to run on my own servers would be cool. I plan to run about 30 VMs that either have to be behind a NAT for IPv4 or (what I would like) my own IPv6 block. There is no NAT for IPv6 to my knolage IPv6 is the only each machine can have it's own addess. I also want to host video so I don't have to use youtube witch is another overhead to my site. Step 1: local host HTML and CSS. Step 2: Local host JS. Step 3: local host images. Step 4: Local host videos. DONE that's all I have to do to finish all this... after the markup... and the code... and the backend server... and the VPN... and the projects... and the memes. Ok no that last one. But I do need to use reddit more because I do.
