# Submitting changes
Firstly, Thank you for considering to make contribution.

To make a contribution please submit a GitHub pull Request with a clear description of what you've changed and/or
added. Please make sure to check out the [code of conduct][6]. Read more about [Pull requests][1] and
[Creating a pull request][2] over at GitHub help.

The more detail you go into on the description the faster a change can be reviewed and processed. There is no standard
for how code should be layed out, however if you are using atom as an IDE I'd recommend using [atom-beautify][3] as
it will make it so that all the code is layed out the similarly. Please try to be quick to respond to discussions
and keep conversation clean and friendly.
