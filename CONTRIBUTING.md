Submitting changes
==================

Firstly, Thank you for considering to make contribution.

To make a contribution please submit a GitHub pull Request with a clear description of what you've changed and/or added. Read more about [Pull requests](https://help.github.com/pull-requests/) and [Creating a pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) over at GitHub help.

The more detail you go into on the description the faster a change can be reviewed and processed. There is no standerd for how code should be layed out, however if you are using atom as an IDE I'd reccomend using [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) as it will make it so that all the code is layed out the simmalerly. Please try to be quick to respond to discussions and keep conversation clean and friendly.
